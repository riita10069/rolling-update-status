## [WIP]rolling update status

It's still under development, so it doesn't work.

You may not know the following two things about deployment.

1. You don't know if rolling deploy is slow on a continuous basis
2. You don't know which commit is being deployed or when it is being deployed

This tool solves these issues.

This tool will allow you to keep track of the time it took to deploy.
And you can use the API to easily see the status of your deployment.
